\section{Biological Context}
Enhancers are non-coding DNA sequences that can influence gene expression when in close 3D proximity to promoters, even if located up to 1Mbp away. They play a key role in gene regulation, contributing to genetic differences between species and individuals by affecting non-coding DNA regions rather than gene coding sequences.


Studying enhancers is vital for understanding gene regulation, disease physiology, and genetic diversity. Enhancers contain Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS), where transcription factors bind to recruit RNA Polymerase II and mediate enhancer-promoter interactions essential for transcriptional activation.
